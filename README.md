# Unsupervised text clustering.

A relatively large dataset containing 1260 sentences, where each 5 sentences describe a unique picture, was used for unsupervised clustering. The goal is to find the 5 sentences that describe the same picture.

The approach here was by cleaning, representing and finally measuring similarity between all of the sentences. Representations and similarity measures were done in different ways. The representations were: Tf-Idf, bag-of-words and LDA. The primary similarity measures used were Cosine, Euclidean and Manhattan. KMeans clustering was also used in order to find similarity.
