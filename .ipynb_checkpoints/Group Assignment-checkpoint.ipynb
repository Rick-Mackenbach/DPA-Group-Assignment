    "The first step of nearly any machine learning analysis project is data cleaning. This is done in order to allow a larger variety of models to work with a predictable input, such that exceptions (in this case special characters such as quotation marks, '[comma]' and others) will not cause any disturbance in the model. The following code loads the data, 'cleans' it, and afterwards sets the entire cleaned data in an array. Comments are added in the code to improve interpretability."
